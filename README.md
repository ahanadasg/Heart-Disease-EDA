# Heart-Disease-EDA
Go to the Kaggle Datasets page to explore the available datasets. You can search for specific datasets using keywords or browse through various categories.
Select a Heart Disease Dataset:
Look for a heart disease dataset that interests you or aligns with your analysis objectives.Click on a dataset to access its details, including a description, file format, size, and any associated kernels or notebooks.
Download the Dataset. If the dataset is available for download, click the "Download" button to save it to your local machine. Make sure to note the file path where you downloaded the dataset.
To load a dataset using Python in Google Colab, follow these steps:
Access Google Colab: Sign in with your Google account.
Create a New Colab Notebook: Click on the "New Notebook" button to create a new Colab notebook.
Upload the Dataset to Google Colab.
After you have uploaded the CSV file, now it is time to read the CSV file. 
Creating pie charts: Using sex and age here for the pie chart.

Creating Violin Plot: Using age(age), resting blood pressure(trestbps), serum cholestoral in mg/dl(chol), maximum heart rate achieved(thalach). The abbreviations used in the excel are given in bracket.

Correlation heatmap: Using values of age, resting blood pressure, serum cholestoral in mg/dl, maximum heart rate achieved, oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect.

Pair Plot: Using values of age, resting blood pressure, serum cholestoral in mg/dl, maximum heart rate achieved, oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect.
